"""The live provenance agent: a Claude-powered conversational audit over Rooted's own tools.

POST /demo/agent answers a visitor's question by running a Claude tool-use loop whose tools are thin
wrappers over the live SBR API (the same surface Rooted's MCP server exposes). The agent can recover
the bundled demo asset through content matching, list the signed transparency-log leaves, recover a
signed manifest by id, and prove a manifest's inclusion under a signed checkpoint. The response
carries the agent's plain-language answer plus the exact trace of tool calls it made, so a judge
sees the agent reasoning over real provenance data, not a canned script.

The endpoint calls a paid model, so it is opt-in and hard-capped. It is enabled only when
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set; until then it returns an honest disabled response that still surfaces the
reachable MCP endpoint and suggested questions, so the panel is useful with no key. When enabled, a
per-IP daily cap, a global daily cap (a true ceiling on model spend: an attempt is never refunded),
an in-flight cap, a turn cap, and a small max_tokens bound the cost. Every model or tool error path
returns a labeled fallback, never a 500, so the demo panel cannot break during judging. The request
body is read with a hard size cap before any work, so a large unauthenticated request cannot exhaust
memory.
