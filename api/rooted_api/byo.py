"""Bring-your-own-asset direct-to-B2 upload (the judge-drops-an-image loop).

The browser asks for a presigned S3 PUT URL, uploads its image DIRECT to the Backblaze B2 S3
endpoint (no proxy through this API), then asks Rooted to register the stored object. Registration
fetches the bytes back from B2 and runs the SAME ingest core as the B2 event-notification webhook
(rooted_api.b2_events.ingest_stored_object): PDQ fingerprint, transparency-log append, and a
content-addressed manifest id, so the visitor's own asset becomes a real registered manifest with a
real inclusion proof, recoverable via /matches/byContent like every other asset.

Security posture (judge-facing, fail closed):
- The object key is server-generated (uuid4 hex under the byo/ prefix); a client-supplied name or
  key never shapes it, and register only accepts keys matching that exact shape.
- The presign constrains Content-Type to an image allowlist and expires in 10 minutes; register
  re-checks the stored size against the shared upload cap BEFORE downloading, then decodes through
  the shared decompression-bomb guard and decode limiter.
- Missing credentials degrade to an honest 503; a missing object is a clear 404; nothing 500s on
  ordinary misuse. No per-IP rate limit exists on this API yet (documented caveat); the body-size
  middleware, the decode limiter, and the 25 MiB cap bound the per-request cost.
