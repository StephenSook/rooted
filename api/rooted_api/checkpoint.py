"""Object-Lock checkpoint: write the signed Merkle tree head to B2 under compliance retention.

A checkpoint is a signed (Ed25519) statement of the transparency tree's size and root at an epoch.
Writing it to a fileLock-enabled B2 bucket with COMPLIANCE retention makes the ledger tamper-evident
at the storage layer: no one, including the operator, can rewrite history without contradicting an
object that physically cannot be deleted until retention expires. The write is best-effort
idempotent per epoch: an existing-object check skips a re-write, the startup seal runs before any
traffic so the concurrent first-write race is tiny, and a retained object can never be replaced.

When B2_BUCKET_LOCKED is not configured the same contract is exercised against the in-memory model
and the surface is labeled `modeled`, so CI and the credential-free demo still prove the behavior.
The endpoint is read-back-and-verify: it re-parses the stored checkpoint, re-verifies its signature
against the published key, and reports the object's own compliance retain-until.
