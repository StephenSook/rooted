"""In-process dedup accounting for the B2 storage paths.

Rooted's object keys are content-addressed (an asset key is its SHA-256; the ingest paths derive
the manifest id from the content), so a repeated write or a repeated register of the same bytes is
answerable without touching Backblaze B2 again. This module counts those events honestly:

- an exists-skip: a store path skipped an upload because the object already exists under its
  content-addressed key (the bytes are already durable in B2);
- an idempotent register: a register call was answered from the existing record (the BYO
  register key cache hit, or the shared ingest core finding the manifest already registered AND
  already in the transparency log).

The counters are module-level and in-process: they start at zero on process start, are never
persisted, and never claim historical totals. GET /demo/storage reports them with that caveat.
