"""Live, rate-limited generation: the judge-driven loop.

POST /demo/generate runs the real generation side of the loop on a visitor's own prompt. Genblaze
generates an image; Rooted signs its manifest (COSE), indexes it for recovery (PDQ on the lean
deploy, where the watermarker stays the fake), appends it to the Merkle transparency log, and writes
it durably to Backblaze B2. The response carries the image and its signed, logged manifest, so the
UI can show the credentialed asset, let the visitor strip it (an in-browser re-encode or a
screenshot), and recover it through POST /matches/byContent.

The endpoint spends real money (a Genblaze provider call), so it is hard-capped: a per-IP daily
limit, a global daily limit (a true ceiling on provider attempts: an attempt is a potential spend,
so it is never refunded), and an in-flight concurrency cap, all in-memory (the deploy is a single
instance). Every exhaustion or failure path serves the seeded demo asset, labeled, so the loop
always closes: a spent budget, a busy generator, a disabled deploy, or a provider error all return
the seed (a real prior Genblaze image that is itself registered for recovery), never a hard error.
The body is read with a hard size cap before any work, so a large unauthenticated request cannot
exhaust memory. Recovery uses the nearest PDQ fingerprint, and in the live flow the visitor recovers
their own freshly generated asset, which is by construction the nearest match.
