"""Integrity-clash detection: the embedded C2PA claim versus the recovered registry record.

Rooted holds two provenance layers for an asset: the manifest EMBEDDED in the file (which anyone
can strip, replace, or forge) and the registry record RECOVERED by watermark or fingerprint (which
is signed and anchored in the transparency log). When the two disagree on a load-bearing field,
that disagreement is evidence of laundered or forged provenance, and Rooted names it field by
field instead of returning a bare boolean. The comparison here is pure computation over the two
inputs; nothing in a verdict is hardcoded.

Compared fields (load-bearing only): whether the asset is AI-generated (an IPTC digitalSourceType
of trainedAlgorithmicMedia versus a concrete generative model in the registry record), the
generator model, the provider, and the asset SHA-256 when the embedded claim carries one. Values
are diffed in canonical form (trimmed, casefolded text; lowercased hex), never str() reprs, so a
case or whitespace difference is not reported as a forgery.
