"""App-level request-body size guard.

The per-endpoint upload caps in sbr.py run AFTER ``await file.read()`` has already buffered the
whole body, and Starlette spools unbounded file parts to disk during receive, so an
unauthenticated POST to the public recovery endpoints could exhaust disk or RAM before the cap is
ever consulted. This middleware enforces a single global ceiling BEFORE the body is materialized:
it rejects a declared Content-Length over the cap, and accumulates streamed bytes to stop a
chunked body that lies about (or omits) its length. The client gets a clean 413, and the
per-endpoint caps remain as a second line of defense.
