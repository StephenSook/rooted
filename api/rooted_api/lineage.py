"""C2PA provenance lineage: parse the ingredient DAG from a credentialed asset, for the graph.

GET /demo/lineage reads the bundled lineage asset (a real C2PA derivation: a generation, two edits,
and a composite, each a signed manifest with cryptographically-linked ingredients) and returns the
ingredient DAG as nodes + edges for the front-end force graph. Validation runs against the C2PA
conformance test trust list, so the lineage carries the green "Trusted" state honestly (the signing
certificate is FOR TESTING ONLY; production validates against the C2PA production trust list). The
asset is static, so the parsed DAG is computed once and cached.
