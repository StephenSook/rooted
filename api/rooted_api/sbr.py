"""The vendor-neutral C2PA Soft Binding Resolution API (C2PA v2.4 route shapes).

The resolver uses the Postgres index when DATABASE_URL is set and the in-memory index otherwise, so
the recovery path runs end to end with or without credentials. The B2 store and the TrustMark
watermarker swap in at the same seams. The /ingest route is a convenience for the demo; the spec
query routes are byContent and byBinding.

Response models inherit from CamelModel, so the HTTP surface (and the generated OpenAPI) emit
camelCase aliases, while model_dump() stays snake_case for storage, canonical hashing, and signing.
