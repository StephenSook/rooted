"""Tamper-diff forensics: when a manifest is altered, recover the AUTHENTIC one from the registry
and show WHICH signed field changed, not just a binary pass/fail.

The COSE signature (over the canonical payload: manifest id, asset sha256, created-at, system
provenance) proves tamper; the diff makes it forensic: the registry's authentic value next to the
submitted (altered) value, per signed field. Degrades honestly (falls back to the demo manifest if
the registry has no entry), never 500.
