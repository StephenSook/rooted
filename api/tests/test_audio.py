"""Tests for the audio recovery modality (the audio analog of the image SBR loop).

Network-free: in-memory image + audio resolvers, the audio demo seeded. The headline is that the
seeded demo audio, once re-encoded (the audio "strip"), recovers to its manifest by the perceptual
audio fingerprint, with the recovered manifest naming the real generator. Non-audio uploads are
rejected, and audio recovery uses a separate index so it never cross-matches an image.
