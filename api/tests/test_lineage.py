"""Tests for the C2PA provenance lineage DAG (/demo/lineage + parse_lineage).

The integration test reads the committed lineage asset (a real C2PA derivation: a generation, two
edits, and a composite) through the endpoint and asserts the trusted diamond DAG. It runs in CI: the
asset and the conformance anchors are committed, no signing key needed. The unit test exercises the
parser on a synthetic store with no c2pa dependency, including an ingredient whose manifest is
absent (which must not produce a dangling edge).
