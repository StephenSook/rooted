"""GET /demo/remark-failover: a real watermark-REMOVAL attack does not defeat recovery.

The combinatorial verdict cases mock at the decode/match seam (a FakeWatermarker for the watermark
decode, the resolver for the fingerprint match) so they run without torch. One integration test uses
the REAL TrustMark variant P: it stages the real removal attack and confirms the real decoder is
defeated while the real PDQ fingerprint still recovers the manifest. It is skipped when the
`watermark` extra is absent, the same way the other real-TrustMark tests are.
