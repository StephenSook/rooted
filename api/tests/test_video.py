"""Tests for the video recovery modality (per-keyframe PDQ).

Network-free: in-memory resolvers, the video demo seeded. The headline is that the seeded demo
video, once re-encoded (the video "strip"), recovers to its manifest because at least one sampled
frame's fingerprint still matches. Cross-modal isolation holds: a video is rejected by the image
route, and garbage is rejected by the video route.
