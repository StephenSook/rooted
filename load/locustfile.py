"""Demo-safety load smoke for the Rooted SBR read endpoints. Run before a demo or deploy:

    uv run uvicorn rooted_api.main:app --port 8000        # one shell
    uvx locust -f load/locustfile.py --host http://localhost:8000 --headless -u 20 -r 5 -t 15s

It hits the read endpoints (liveness, supportedAlgorithms, byBinding, a 404 manifest, the signed
checkpoint) AND the real recovery path the demo actually exercises: POST /matches/byContent, which
decodes the uploaded image and computes a PDQ hash (CPU-bound, offloaded to the threadpool) but
writes nothing. Watch the p95 latency and failure rate so the live demo will not fall over under
concurrent judges. locust is run via uvx so it is not a project dependency.
