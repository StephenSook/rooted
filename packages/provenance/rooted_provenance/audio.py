"""Audio perceptual fingerprint: the audio analog of the image PDQ fallback resolver.

The recovery threat is the same as for images: an asset is re-encoded (mp3/aac/ogg, a sample-rate
change) and stripped of any embedded credential, and we recover its manifest by a perceptual match.
The approach reuses the image core verbatim. Decode the audio to canonical mono PCM with ffmpeg,
compute a log-mel spectrogram in pure numpy (no scipy / librosa / torch), render it as a grayscale
image, and hash THAT image with the same pdqhash used for pictures (compute_pdq). A re-encode leaves
the spectrogram (and so the 256-bit hash) almost unchanged, while an unrelated clip is far away, so
the existing bit-string Hamming index recovers audio with no new matcher and no new dependency.

Like PDQ, this is an INTERNAL index only; it is never advertised as a C2PA soft-binding algorithm.

Empirically gated (Gate-1-audio, on a real Suno clip with this pure-numpy pipeline): re-encode
distances (mp3 64-192k, aac, resample) were <= 20/256 while an unrelated clip sat at ~98/256, so the
image Hamming threshold of 31 recovers re-encodes with margin.
