"""Merkle transparency log: append-only proof that a manifest existed and was not altered.

Each manifest's canonical hash becomes a leaf. Periodically the signed tree head (a checkpoint) is
written to B2 under Object Lock, so the ledger is tamper-evident: no one, including the operator,
can rewrite history without contradicting a checkpoint that physically cannot be deleted.
