"""Shared provenance contracts and canonicalization.

Every component (storage, fingerprint, signing, claim, Merkle log, the SBR API) builds against
these models. The canonical hash is the deterministic anchor: a manifest is serialized to canonical
JSON (sorted keys, no insignificant whitespace, UTF-8) and SHA-256'd. The same bytes are what we
sign and what we add to the Merkle log, so the three layers agree by construction.
