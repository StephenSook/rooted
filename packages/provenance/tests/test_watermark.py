"""Watermarker: the in-process fake (always), and the real TrustMark variant P round-trip.

The real-library tests need the `watermark` extra (trustmark + torch), which CI does not install
(CI runs `uv sync --all-packages`, not `--all-extras`). They are skipped when trustmark is absent,
so CI stays green and fast; run them locally with `uv sync --extra watermark` to verify the real
encode -> decode loop and that the watermark survives the pipeline's own JPEG re-encode.

Carrier note: the two trust layers have opposite carrier needs. TrustMark embeds in natural
mid-frequency content (a smooth gradient works; random noise does not), while PDQ needs real
structure to produce a stable hash (a flat gradient gives a low-quality, fragile hash). So the tests
use a synthetic-but-representative carrier (smooth gradient + soft blobs + mild texture) that has
both, which is what real generated media looks like. The full loop on real generated images is
exercised separately by the live ingest script once a provider is funded. A pristine image can also
spuriously decode as "present" with a garbage payload; that is harmless for Rooted because a
watermark id is trusted only after it matches a stored manifest AND the asset fingerprint-matches it
(the resolver's cross-layer check).
