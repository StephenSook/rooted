"""PostgresIndex: the recovery Index, backed by Postgres.

Implements the Index protocol (see rooted_provenance.resolver.Index) on Postgres:

- manifests as jsonb keyed by manifest id,
- watermark bindings as an exact-match primary-key lookup (a B-tree),
- PDQ perceptual hashes as native bit(256).

Nearest-fingerprint search has two wired paths, chosen at startup by the database's capability: with
pgvector 0.7+ it uses the `<~>` Hamming operator accelerated by an HNSW bit_hamming_ops index (the
production path on the live Postgres deploy); without pgvector, or pre-0.7, it falls back to the
exact Postgres bit_count of the XOR (`#`), which needs no extension. Both return the same nearest
(manifest_id, distance) for the curated recovery set; the path is selected automatically.

Connections come from a psycopg_pool.ConnectionPool with a liveness check on checkout, so a dropped
connection (a Postgres restart or idle timeout over a multi-day window) self-heals instead of
wedging recovery. register() runs the three index writes in one transaction, so a partial ingest
rolls back rather than orphaning an unrecoverable manifest. The API layer offloads these blocking
calls off the event loop. The remaining synchronous-vs-async driver swap is the only deferred item.
