"""PostgresTransparencyStore: a durable, ordered record of the Merkle leaves.

Implements rooted_provenance.merkle.LeafStore. The transparency tree is in-memory and rebuilt by
replaying these leaves in order on startup, so inclusion proofs survive a restart or a second
instance instead of resetting to an empty tree while manifests persist in Postgres. Connections come
from a pooled, self-healing ConnectionPool, the same posture as PostgresIndex.
