"""One-shot: prove (and enable) Backblaze B2 Object Lock for the Merkle checkpoint seal.

Run this yourself so your B2 credentials load from your shell / .env and are never exposed to anyone
else:

    uv run python scripts/activate_object_lock.py rooted-locked

What it does, in order, printing a clear PASS or FAIL at each step:
  1. Authorizes B2 and prints the key's capabilities (not the secret) so you can confirm it has
     writeFileRetentions + readFileRetentions (needed for Object Lock).
  2. Gets or creates the named bucket with Object Lock enabled (fileLock can only be turned on, and
     for a brand-new bucket it must be set at creation).
  3. Writes a tiny probe object under a SHORT compliance retention (default 1 day) so it auto-frees.
  4. Reads the retention back from B2 and asserts it is compliance with a future retain-until.
  5. Attempts to delete the retained probe and asserts B2 refuses it (the WORM guarantee).

If every step passes, it prints the bucket name to set as B2_BUCKET_LOCKED on the rooted-api Render
service. Nothing here touches the rooted-dev iteration bucket. The probe is short-lived.
