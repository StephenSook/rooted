"""One-shot: configure the Backblaze B2 CORS rule that lets the browser PUT a BYO upload DIRECT to
the dev bucket via a presigned S3 URL (rooted_api.byo). Reads B2 credentials from .env (no secret
literal in this file), in the style of configure_b2_event_rule.py.

B2 CORS rules are bucket-scoped (there is no per-prefix scoping), so the rule is scoped by origin +
method instead: only the production web origin and localhost may PUT, only the content-type header
is allowed, and the byo/ key shape is enforced server-side by the API (server-generated keys only).

Safety: dry-run by default (prints the exact rule and the resulting rule set, mutates nothing);
pass --apply to write. Idempotent: an identical existing rule is a no-op, a stale same-name rule is
replaced, every other rule is preserved. It refuses to touch the Object-Lock bucket
(B2_BUCKET_LOCKED) no matter what the env says.

Run: uv run python scripts/configure_b2_byo_cors.py           # dry run (default)
     uv run python scripts/configure_b2_byo_cors.py --apply   # actually write the rule
