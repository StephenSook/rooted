# Publish the rooted-sbr CLI to PyPI.
#
# One-time setup (yours):
#   1. create a PyPI account at https://pypi.org/account/register/ and verify the email,
#   2. create an API token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/token/ (scope: entire account for the
#      first upload; you can narrow it to the rooted-sbr project after it exists),
#   3. put it in .env as:  PYPI_TOKEN=pypi-...
#
# Then run once from the repo root:  bash scripts/publish_cli_pypi.sh
# It rebuilds the sdist + wheel, runs twine check, and uploads with the token. A PyPI version can
# never be re-uploaded, so this is intentionally a clean rebuild + validate before upload.
